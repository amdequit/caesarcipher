## Introduction

Authors: Angeline Dequit

## Requirements

This module requires an application that can read Python such as Pycharm, Visual Studio Code or Replit. 

## Configuration

Note: This code was written in replit so the process described is how it is run on replit. Methods may vary with another ide/cmd line.

1. Download or copy .py file
2. Follow the steps:
  a. Upload .py file or paste in code to a .py file 
  b. Press Run
  c. Navigate to the console
  d. Follow instructions in console.

Notes:
1.  you may find it faster to add encode(), decode() to the .py file and hard code your messages instead of typing it. to do so, comment out the last main() statement and add either the encode() or decode() function to the body, and run.
